			<h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>
				<h5>Version 1</h5>
					<p>Hi my name is Joe. I create functionally artistic, modern websites and apps that help clients market
						themselves and increase their sales/online-presence. I'm doing this by utizling the coding skills I've acquired
						during my time at the Deep Dive Bootcamp as well as by meeting with clients to make sure they get the best product possible.
						Are you in need of a website? </p>
				<h5>Version 2</h5>
					<p>Hi my name is Joe. I am currently aiming to gain full-time employment in the tech industry with a small to
					medium sized web development company and apply the knowledge I have gained from my bootcamp experience in order to help them grow. I am trying to setup meetings with employers or find mentorship with an experienced developer in order
					to further my skills.</p>

			<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<p>This week went by pretty fast. We immediately began learning about databases. I felt like I struggled a
					bit with the planning stage since I've never done that before. I must say it was tough figuring out the
					relationships between databases. I'm sure it will take years to master but I'm still pretty excited about
					getting into this field.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<p>The week started off pretty tough. We were assigned several function challenges in JavaScript and PHP. I was
				able to get the JavaScript to work pretty easily but the PHP really stumped me. I realize I need to do much
				more studying in PHP in order to really become a good web-developer. I also need to think deeper about what kind of person I am and what defines me.</p>
