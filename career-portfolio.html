			<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<p>This week went by pretty fast. We immediately began learning about databases. I felt like I struggled a
					bit with the planning stage since I've never done that before. I must say it was tough figuring out the
					relationships between databases. I'm sure it will take years to master but I'm still pretty excited about
					getting into this field.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<p>The week started off pretty tough. We were assigned several function challenges in JavaScript and PHP. I was
				able to get the JavaScript to work pretty easily but the PHP really stumped me. I realize I need to do much
				more studying in PHP in order to really become a good web-developer. I also need to think deeper about what kind of person I am and what defines me.</p>
			<h4>Week 3</h4>
