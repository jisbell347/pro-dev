			<h3>Weekly Reflections</h3>
			<h4>Week 1</h4>
				<p>This week went by pretty fast. We immediately began learning about databases. I felt like I struggled a
					bit with the planning stage since I've never done that before. I must say it was tough figuring out the
					relationships between databases. I'm sure it will take years to master but I'm still pretty excited about
					getting into this field.</p>
			<h4>Week 2</h4>
				<p>The week started off pretty tough. We were assigned several function challenges in JavaScript and PHP. I was
				able to get the JavaScript to work pretty easily but the PHP really stumped me. I realize I need to do much
				more studying in PHP in order to really become a good web-developer. I also need to think deeper about what kind of person I am and what defines me.</p>
			<h4>Week 3</h4>
				<p>This week we formed our capstone groups. I really enjoy the people that are a part of my team and I am
					excited about our project. We hit a few snags in the design process but we managed to come together and work it out. The CSS
					challenge we were presented with was tough but helped me learn more about the flex system and I really enjoyed it.</p>
