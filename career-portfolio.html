						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 1</h4>
								<p>This week went by pretty fast. We immediately began learning about databases. I felt like I struggled a
									bit with the planning stage since I've never done that before. I must say it was tough figuring out the
									relationships between databases. I'm sure it will take years to master but I'm still pretty excited about
									getting into this field.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 2</h4>
								<p>The week started off pretty tough. We were assigned several function challenges in JavaScript and PHP. I was
									able to get the JavaScript to work pretty easily but the PHP really stumped me. I realize I need to do much
									more studying in PHP in order to really become a good web-developer. I also need to think deeper about what kind of person I am and what defines me.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 3</h4>
								<p>This week we formed our capstone groups. I really enjoy the people that are a part of my team and I am
									excited about our project. We hit a few snags in the design process but we managed to come together and work it out. The CSS
									challenge we were presented with was tough but helped me learn more about the flex system and I really enjoyed it.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 4</h4>
							<p>This week we continued work on our capstone project. I had a few issues with one of my teammates but we talked it over
								and got it straightened out. I am proud of the work my team is doing so far and the progress we are making! I had a lot
								of fun building the bootstrap challenge we were presented with this week. One of the reasons why I love coding so much is
								that it allows me to express my creativity and share that with others through the stuff I make.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 5</h4>
							<p>This week we finished writing our unit tests and got them all to pass! We also started JavaScript which is challenging but I'm excited to
						learn more about it and become better at it. I'm hoping the API's will go well and we won't have too many problems writing them.
							Then on to Angular! Another reason I love to code is because it allows me to problem-solve and figure stuff out.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 6</h4>
							<p>Week 6 went well. We worked on writing API's and started testing them. The API I was assigned was particularly difficult so I spent quite a bit of
							time researching and reading documentation. Luckily, I was able to solve the problem with the help of the bridge and it passed successfully. My team also finished
							writing their API's and we are now in the process of testing. Looking forward to seeing the project come to life! I also enjoying coding because it is rewarding when you
							are able to solve a particularly complex problem.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 7</h4>
							<p>The week went by pretty quickly. Our group was able to finish testing our APIs as well as start our Angular portion of the project.
								I am really pleased with the pace we are setting and the skills of my team! We also started building the front-end part of our site which is really exciting!
								It's really cool to see the project coming together. Another reason I love coding is because it allows me to make really awesome projects that can benefit the others.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 8</h4>
							<p>This week, we started on implementing the Angular components and grabbing the data from the database to display on the page. The website structure is in place and looking really good!
							I'm happy with my team's drive to create the site and the progress we are making. We also had our interviews this week which I was pretty nervous about, especially the HR one. However,
							after meeting with Mia Peterson from RSI, I felt really comfortable and excited about how the interview went. I'm hoping to get a job with RSI, but if not, I can use what I've learned from the
							interviews to move forward and apply at the next business.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 9</h4>
							<p>This week, we really pushed hard to get our website mostly up and running! Had some setbacks along the way and spent all day on Thursday banging my head on the keyboard trying to implement the
								search feature functionality to allow users to search by specific things. However, we made a breakthrough and had success getting it to work! We also practiced presenting for demo day which
								was interesting but gave my team a good idea of how to go forward.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="reflections-week">
							<h4>Week 10</h4>
							<p>Week 10 is finally here! It went by really fast! I'm really proud of my team for the hard work they put in over the last several weeks. We managed to create a fully functional site that went above and beyond what we were hoping to accomplish.
							Really excited to see what the future holds.</p>

						<p>My team consisted of Adel, Asya, Jude and myself. I felt like we cooperated really well to win the
							game. Adel and Jude are very strategic minded and communicated effectively to help coordinate our
							teams movements. Asya was very logical and calm and thought through each move we all made to ensure we made the best
							possible choices. What I learned about myself is that I have a tendency to take the lead and I had to force myself to
							slow down, follow and trust my team. Overall, I'm very proud of the teamwork my team displayed and the calm,
							level-headed attitude of everyone that led to our success.</p>
